            <h3>Why Care?</h3>
            <p class="info">
                There is a deep longing for a brighter, greener, more hopeful and prosocial future than the default dark future it seems that we are on track for.  Web 2.0, the VC-funded, ad-driven, algorithm-powered, privacy-breaching, culture-polarizing Web we are all familiar with, has created dystopian antisocial media and apps that are giving rise to that dark future. The next generation of the World Wide Web is coming, some people are calling it web3 and others are calling it DWeb.  It represents a new hope to create a brighter future for us all if shaped in the right way.
                <br>
                <br>
                All the major challenges that humanity faces are the result of collective action failures. We are keenly aware of the need to build a new Web that embeds care, compassion and effective collective action into its principles, protocols and practices. A Web that enables the creation of software that embodies the best of what we know about creating communities, commons and shared meaning.  A Web that supports our cognition rather than exploits our attention. That is the call we are answering in our work on DWeb. 
            </p>

            <h3>Why DWeb Camp</h3>
            <p class="info">
                DWeb Camp is the most important event in the Web3/DWeb space. The people at this August 2022 event are the ones that are working on building the infrastructure for an internet that is made by the people and for the people. Not in a democratic sense, but a structural one. It’s where the elders of the internet gather with the next generation of inventors, thought leaders, philosophers, and creators. It’s a place for looking at what’s not working in the current system while working towards creating one that meets the same needs, but does so in a way that’s more conducive to the best aspects of human nature, like connection, individual sovereignty, learning, play, communication, cooperation etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Us?</h3>
            <p class="info">
                We are digital commons activists engaged with projects aiming to shape the Web3/DWeb in a prosocial way, applying the proven group forming power of the Web to supporting the emergence of egalitarian and compassionate communities.  We believe that prosocial DWeb software should address the critical social, economic and environmental needs of the communities they serve. Whether they be communities of place, communities of interest or communities of practice. <br> 
                <br>
                We want to foster a tech environment dedicated to creating socially accountable structures. By using frameworks optimized for accountability and by adopting the tech that empowers a group of individuals to hold one another accountable to a shared set of rules.  DWeb and the prosocial software we will build on it can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem as the current Web and the antisocial media built on it is <br>
                <br>
                We believe that we can make critical contributions to DWeb Camp. Our challenge is that as people who have the knowledge, experience and skills to make tech less harmful and more prosocial, we don’t have a lot of funds due to the nonprofit nature of our work. <br>

                            <br>
                            In my teens, a big part of my life was built around a leisure group with kids - here in Catalunya they are called Esplais - where we did summer camps, learned and sang and just played a lot of games. Those experiences were really powerful, as it's just a different feeling when we were with a small group of people 2 weeks in the forest, managing everything by ourselves. <br>
                            <br>
                            After that, I graduated in Computer Science, mainly because I loved how coding enabled me to bring an idea I'd had in my head to reality, and have other people play with it. When I entered the job market, I felt mostly meaningless... Like my work didn't do any good at all for anyone. <br>
                            <br>
                            So then, I discovered blockchain and Web3, and got really excited about the possibility of real-life experiments that they could enable. In those years, I co-founded the Underscore Protocol, a way to create and evolve data in a forkable and interoperable way. <br>
                            <br>
                            Eventually I found Holochain, which inspired me due to its biomimicry foundations, and since then, I've been a really active member in its community. More recently I've been working on a lot of different projects related to Holochain infrastructure and apps. <br>
                            <br>
                            These are the areas that currently interest me the most: mutual-credit currencies, mutual learning and curriculum infrastructure, and small tools that allow peer-to-peer coordination of small groups (task management, value accounting, conditional commitments...). <br>
                            <br>
                            I'd love to be able to create modular and reusable open-source infrastructure around these topics that would enable small experiments in real life, attuned to their context and problems. <br>

                            <b>Viktor is an economist, technologist, mushroom farmer and permaculture practitioner.</b> <br>
                            <br>
                            I grew up with computers and was a kid going online in the mid 90’s, peer-to-peer software, social spaces like mIRC and ICQ informed me growing up. I’ve experienced the richness of what digital spaces can offer, especially for people that live in edge cultures and new perspectives. <br>
                            <br>
                            After training as an economist and technologist, I shifted paths around 10 years ago to study permaculture and have fallen into a strong dedication in my work towards vitality and ecosystemic health. I am now applying my love for networks and technology in service of abundant clean water, healthy soils and healthy food for everyone. <br>
                            <br>
                            As a mushroom farmer and mycologist I have observed how health is dependent on rich relationships and that when we realize how woven we are into our places we find collaborations where we can really benefit the whole including ourselves. I want to use the technology that is forthcoming to enable people to grow ecosystems around them, so that we can eat, live and play in a way that benefits the whole. <br>
                            <br>
                            Concretely this is being implemented right now in software for food production and distribution, collaboration and sharing infrastructure as well as learning tools for living systems exploration. I love the way Holochain may enable us to see ourselves and behave as cells, super-organisms and vital organs in life on this planet. <br>

                            I've done a lot of stuff in web and games, got involved with blockchain after seeing potential in Ethereum in 2014, became disillusioned and left that industry in 2018 after seeing firsthand the ways in which naive techno-optimism harms people and subverts ideology. <br>
                            <br>
                            I've a big interest in governance, human social structures and the decentralization of power, and feel it an imperative to educate others on the web3 space to help in disentangling notions of technological and social progress. <br>
                            <br>
                            I do a lot of protocol work on <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/" target="_blank">value flows</a> and supporting infrastructure to help create a distributed web of autonomous, community-lead economic systems. <a href="https://hrea.io/" target="_blank">hREA.io</a>, <a href="http://bonfirenetworks.org/" target="_blank">bonfire networks</a> and <a href="https://reflowproject.eu/" target="_blank">reflow project EU</a> are the 3 main projects currently building towards this goal. We aim to create a post-monetary, resource-based economy of mutual interdependence. <br>
                            <br>
                            Aside from protocols and infrastructural work on hREA, I work with grassroots groups on building & deploying their own community coordination systems. I also consult with a few Indigenous sociologists critiquing and working at the intersection of the decentralization movement and decolonial theory. My main current interests are in internalized oppression, post-colonial governance, and in deploying technologies to support and amplify the voices of marginalized communities- particularly those facing social and environmental oppression from the colonial and capitalist forces either overtly operating in the wider world or hiding within our own conceptions of r/evolution. <br>

                            <br>
                            I was born in Japan but ended up moving to and growing up in the Philippines when I was 6. I was fortunate enough to learn 3 languages (Japanese, Tagalog, English) simultaneously which helped me appreciate the many unique ways languages can represent culturally contextual information. Soaking up two cultures that are quite different from each other (Japanese and Filipino) early on helped me appreciate the things you can only experience when you fully immerse yourself in the context of where and who you are with. This early experience led me to fall in love with Holochain as it deeply values contextual information in an agent centric world it is trying to build. <br>
                            <br>
                            During my college years, I started self learning programming but I was always more eager to understand how the current world order works economically, socially, politically, and financially.  The more I understood it (or so I thought), the more it felt like something is not really right. And Blockchain at first seemed like it could actually do some things better than how it is being done today. <br>
                            <br>
                            And so during my college years, I worked together with a local blockchain project which was trying to create a loyalty program. However, at this time, things still didn’t really “click” in me. But all this changed when one of my colleagues introduced me to Holochain. As I read the white paper, many “yes, that’s it!” or “Wow yeah!” voice was repeating in my head. This was the start of my journey in Web 3/distributed systems and networks. And after graduating college, I started a software development company with Akira (he’s also here) whom I share a lot of my vision with til this day. <br>
                            <br>
                            And so we continued to learn about Holochain and meet more people in the community as we started our small company. As we did, we fell in love with what Holochain tries to enable in the world. And we started to play around with an idea of creating a chat tool/app that is attune to the real need of the people who use the app. An app that can make you feel confident and comfortable in building bonds with one another. <br>
                            <br>
                            And out of this, Kizuna (A Japanese term for “deep bond”) messaging application project was started. You can find out more about it <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/ " target="_blank">here</a>. Our aim is to create distributed tools and applications that can redistribute power, resources, and information without losing contextual information and without ever needing to have one figure or entity control the flow of the entire resource of the community/organization/etc. <br>

                            I’m 25 years old, born and living in the Philippines with dreams and aspirations to establish a company that builds impactful software products and services that push humanity forward and upward. <br> 
                            <br>
                            Right after college, I established a software development company with Tats who I share many visions with. I hired talented Filipino developers and managed the business while Tats taught himself how to be a programmer. On our first year, we worked on centralized business operations projects which aimed to increase a company’s productivity and profit. While I learned so much, it didn’t feel like the right thing to do and it is misaligned with the vision we set for our team. We were just making the company and its shareholders rich. It didn’t feel sustainable for me to continue working on similar projects in the long run. <br>
                            <br>
                            And so we started looking around for projects worth doing, then one day Tats told me about Holochain and how it could be the “next big thing”. We got on a few introductory calls with some members of the Holochain community and instantly felt energized and safe- meeting people from all over the world, in different aspects of life, with different experiences, and different age groups who share similar visions and are taking hours off their day to do volunteer work in order to push the project forward little-by-little and I already knew we were going to be part of something great. <br>
                            <br>
                            In late 2020, we felt we learned enough to start our own and we found <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/ " target="_blank">Kizuna</a> messaging application a distributed, peer-to-peer, non-profit messaging application built on Holochain that prioritizes privacy, security, and user-centricity. <br>
                            <br>
                            Today Kizuna is almost at its Beta stage and we’ve grown a community that supports the project. We want to keep working on this project so you can use Kizuna with your friends and loved ones. <br>

                            Buzzwordy, but reflective of my interest in maximizing individual wellbeing in community.  I see human beings as fundamentally social animals, who construct their reality socially which is very much a double edged sword when bad narratives and conspiracy theories take hold. <br>
                            <br>  
                            Constructing societies as zero-sum games where winners take all is very much a political choice and a very bad and ultimately unsustainable form of political economy at this point.  I'm interested in redesigning our fundamental institutions as trustworthy positive-sum games that enable us all to flourish in a world that is regenerating, powered by renewable energy. <br>
                            <br>
                            I have a deep interest in architecting social software that help autonomous communities make decisions, pool resources and get things done, with a focus on meeting real human needs and fostering a culture of care and connection. <br>
                            <br>
                            I've been an advocate of UBI and participatory democracy for many years. <br>
                            <br>
                            I've worked on a lot of projects over the years, but notably I helped found the Brixton Pound and had a radically different vision from what ultimately emerged.  My vision was for a mobile, prosocial currency connecting youth with the elderly.  I have a background with community currencies like timebanks and LETS.  That's how I first came across the Metacurrency Project many years ago.  Which led me to Holo. <br>
                            <br>
                            I was a co-founder of London Creative Labs which was a radical intervention to help workless people become better advocates of themselves and each other and to help communities create decent jobs locally.  In retrospect, we were prototyping something adjacent to the Preston Model of Community Wealth Building.  So I have experience as a social/policy entrepreneur. <br>
